### Tips & Best Practices

#### 🎯 Setting Realistic Targets

**Starting Target:**
- Choose something you can currently do comfortably
- You should be able to complete it even on tired days

**Weekly Increase:**
- Conservative: 5-10% of starting target
- Moderate: 10-20%
- Aggressive: 20-30%

**Max Target:**
- For reps: 3-5x your starting amount
- For distance: 2-3x your starting amount
- For time: 2-4x your starting duration

#### 📅 Maintaining Your Streak

- **Check in daily** - Even if you can't complete everything
- **Do exercises earlier** in the day when you have more energy
- **Partial completion** is better than none
- **Rest days**: The app doesn't have them yet, but consider taking one day off per week

#### 💪 Progressive Overload Strategy

**If progression feels too easy:**
- Increase your weekly increment
- Lower your max target to level up faster

**If progression feels too hard:**
- Reduce your weekly increment
- Increase your max target to level up slower
- Modify the exercise (e.g., knee push-ups vs regular)

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I change my exercises?**
